# PRODIGY_CS_04

## Overview

This project demonstrates the creation of a basic keylogger using Python and the `pynput` library. A keylogger is a program designed to record and log keystrokes made by a user. This program logs the keys pressed and stores them in a file.

## Important Note

When working with keyloggers, ethical considerations and permissions are crucial. Using keyloggers to capture keystrokes without proper authorization is illegal and unethical. This program is meant for educational purposes only. Always ensure you have explicit consent before utilizing keylogging tools.
